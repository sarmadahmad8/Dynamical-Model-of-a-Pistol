# Dynamical-Model-of-a-Pistol
This is my attempt at mathematically modelling the dynamics of a pistol. This is based on a research paper published on the dynamical model of training pistols, but the simplifications can be applied to any handgun and the model can be fit to any handgun of choice if the specifications of that hand gun are known.

The research paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214914719301163#sec6

The MandS_Project_Pistol_Research_Paper file is a direct implementation of the research paper system equations while the MandS_Project_Pistol_Simplified_Real file is a simplified version of the research paper system equations fitted to my pistol of choice.
The photoshop file contains the schematic diagram of the mechanical system and can also be editted according to your assumptions and initial conditions
