# Dynamical-Model-of-a-Pistol
This is my attempt at mathematically modelling the dynamics of a pistol. This is based on a research paper published on the dynamical model of training pistols, but the simplifications can be applied to any handgun and the model can be fit to any handgun of choice if the specifications of that hand gun are known.
